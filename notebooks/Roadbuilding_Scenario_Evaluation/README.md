## Using these notebooks

These notebooks provide a pathway to using the friction surfaces and destinations previously generated to measure the anticipated gains from a collection of proposed investments (scenarios). In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa these investments were roads upgrades and we prioritized accordingly -- but this process could alternately handle collections of schools, hospitals, or combinations thereof, with adaptation.

Step 1 - Aligns the proposed roads for upgrade with the data model we have used for modeling road speeds.

Step 2 - Generates friction surfaces per proposed road segments for the extent of that road. Revises the status quo friction surfaces to reflect the known, status quo conditions of those proposed roads -- on the expectation some roads may be modeled incorrectly absent primary data.

Step 3 - Creates status quo access surfaces for comparison

Step 4 - Create friction surfaces for the entire project area for each road. Use these to generate access surfaces for each road / season / destination combination. This is a LONG process.

Step 5 - Compare the generated access surfaces for each (road) investment scenario to the status quo and quantify the improvements. Quantify by taking the difference (improvement in time), multiplying it by the underlying population, and summarizing the results. These can be further compared to status quo access in the roads' catchment area to yield a percentile (relative) improvement.
